# Book Rental API

This repository just demonstrates how to build a Book Rental API using NestJS and GraphQL.

This API is built following the [Code First](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start#code-first) approach.

## Features

Here is a list of all the stuff you will see when looking around:

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  - The ORM used to interact with the database.
  - MySQL is the database used in this project.
  - You can view a list of scripts to interact with the database in the `package.json` file.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  - The API is built using GraphQL.
  - It follows the [Code First](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start#code-first) approach.
  - You can view the generated schema in the [`src/schema/gql`](src/schema.gql) file.
- [Authentication](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/passport)
  - The project uses [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication.
  - Both the local & JWT strategies are used.
- [Nest AccessControl (Authorization)](https://github.com/nestjsx/nest-access-control)
  - The project uses the `nest-access-control` package for authorization.
  - You can view the roles & permissions in the [`src/core/auth/app.roles.ts`](src/core/auth/app.roles.ts) file.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - The project is dockerized.
  - You can view the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) and [`compose.yml`](/compose.yml) files in the root directory.
- Security Best Practices
  - The project uses [helmet](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/helmet), [hashing](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/encryption-and-hashing#hashing), [cors](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/cors), [compression](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/compression) & [rate limiting](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/rate-limiting) as described in the NestJS documentation. For creating & updating records, the project uses [class-validator & class-transformer](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation) withing DTO's & Input types.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
  - The project has a cloudinary module that handles file uploads.
- [Configuration](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration)
  - The project uses the `config` module to manage environment variables.
  - There is also a `.env.example` file in the root directory.
  - Validation is done on app startup to ensure that there are no missing environment variables.
- [Health Checks](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus)
  - The project uses the `@nestjs/terminus` package for health checks.
  - The `/health` endpoint currently ensures that the prisma client has access to the Database & that the Email configuration is correct.
- Custom Decorators
  - The project has a few custom decorators that are used to get the [current user](src/common/decorators/current-user.decorator.ts), get the [cookies](src/common/decorators/cookies.ts) & make a route [public](src/common/decorators/public-route.decorator.ts)
- Email
  - The project uses [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to send emails.
  - If you check the [email module](src/common/email/email.module.ts), you will see that there is a `templates` directory that contains the email templates. The email service file is responsible for setting up the transporter and sending the emails.
- Logging - Morgan
  - The project uses [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for logging along with NestJS's built-in logger.
  - The logs are stored in the `logs` directory.
